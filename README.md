# Medieval Industry 2021LTS

This is my thesis project. The goal was to make a RTS/city builder game.  
The main task was an implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm. In the making I made use of Burst Compiler and Job System to make agent pathfinding asynchronous.  
I don't recommend learning Unity by making something like this for your second project (95% googling 5% coding).  
It's a total mess and I therefore announce this project is dead.
